## JIRA Tickets


This folder contains sample JIRA-style defect tickets created as part of this
testing project.

I documented issues the same way I would on a real team — by clearly describing the problem, outlining steps to
reproduce it, and explaining the impact so it’s easy for others to understand why the issue matters.

These tickets are not pulled from a live JIRA instance. They’re included here to
show how I approach defect tracking, prioritization, and communication during
testing, rather than just listing bugs.
